# xonotic_game_mod_menu


## Synopsis

This project was created to give Windows/Mac/Linux Xonotic players a fun way to completely wreck their friends who may/may not be better that them in every way when playing normally. Please do not use this for online gameplay or any ranked/tournament play that could seriously impact prizes or rankings. This will not work on servers with upgraded security/password protection.

## Installation

Download the zip of the repo and extract or download just the mod_v1.0.cfg script and take the mod configuration file and place it in the data folder:

    *path to xonotic folder*/Xonotic/data/

Then, when in a game, execute the script from the command window that can be brought up by hitting the '~' key using this command:

    exec mod_v1.0.cfg

## Usage

Whenever you play on a new server, just execute the script again and use these following keys for complete domination:

| Key:          | Effect:                          |
| ------------- |---------------------------------:|
| c             | all weapons, health, ammo, armor |
| f             | autoswitch to best weapon        |
